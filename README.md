# SALES PITCH

- I made a online clothing brand store under my own name, so that I could create any designs thaat I would like to make. This online store is made to serve customer with utmost satisfactory and to produce the finest clothes in the market. This clothing store caters a large variety of clothes, not only that they also have clothes for any age range from new born babies to the elderly. In our company policy we use the best materials when it comes to making our clothes

# DESIGN PROCESS

- The reason why I decided to make a clothing website is because there is a huge market for clothing currently.

# TARGETTED AUDIENCE

- The targetted audience of the clothing brand are mainly teenagers and young working adults. For teenagers nowsaday they care alot about their appearances and fashion. So, they would be willing to spend their money on clothes. As for young working adult, since they are working they would have a lot of disposable income to be able to spend & splurge their money on clothes.
